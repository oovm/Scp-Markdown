SCP-1339的相片



**項目編號：** SCP-1339

**項目等級：** Safe

**特殊收容措施：** SCP-1339被保存在Site-56的保險箱內，需有Williams博士的允許才能打開。所有有關的實驗都已被無限延期直到進一步的指示。

**描述：** SCP-1339是個警徽，但沒有任何所屬分局或階級的標示。截至20██/3/1為止並無類似的警徽被發現。它異常的特性只在被人別上時才會顯現。

當SCP-1339被別在一人身上時（其他生物也可能被SCP-1339影響，見實驗日誌）——以下皆敘述實驗對象——對象會相信他所做的一切行為都是完全正確且合理的（見附錄1339-1）。當被問及時，對象永遠會將自己的行為合理化，並捍衛自己的所作所為。對象的運動能力，解答問題的能力及認知能力都被證實並不被SCP-1339損害。基金會的心理學家及言語病理學家注意到受SCP-1339的對象說話的方式就像精神病患和反社會人士。

當SCP-1339從對象身上移除時，對象會立即感到極度的罪惡和沮喪，即使在別上SCP-1339時並沒有做錯任何事。治療的方法就像其他有罪惡感和意志消沉的病患一樣。治療師指出，對象對於抗憂鬱藥和傳統的精神病治療更具抗性。記憶刪除對移除這些偏離的“記憶”特別有效，縱使對象仍報告有罪惡感。大多未接受治療的對象最後都自殺了。在多個場合對象會在遺書內對未確認的罪名懺悔。儘管這對遲遲未破案的案件及找尋失蹤人口有幫助，仍然決定所有有關實驗都被無限期延期，直到有進一步指示。

**附錄1339-1：** 對象已接觸過（在某些案件是實行）謀殺、大規模屠殺、凌遲、強迫飢餓及非事故的無藥物截肢，當被問及時，都宣稱上述行為是完全合理且正確的。

**採訪1339-1** 
D-345871：使用SCP-1339的對象
Torest博士：與D-345871進行訪談

**前言：** D-345871已別上SCP-1339數日了。這幾天他目擊了Larson特工之死，數名D級人員之處決，及SCP-███暴力的逃脫行動。


> **Torest博士：** 你好嗎，D-345781？
> 
> **D-345781：** 很好。你呢？
> 
> **Torest博士：** 不錯。現在，你對這幾天在基金會看到的事感覺怎樣呢？我知道你一些朋友感到不安。
> 
> **D-345781：** 我說了我很好。我了解你們為何做那些事。
> 
> **Torest博士：** 你不對你的參與感到罪惡？
> 
> **D-345781：** 那些事一定得做。
> 
> **Torest博士：** 你為什麼那麼說？
> 
> **D-345781：** 那些人完全是不必要的。他們做好自己份內的事，然後就該死了。不管怎樣他們都太愛抱怨了，尤其是█████，一直不斷抱怨，直到[數據刪除]。至少這讓他安靜下來了。
> 

**結語：** SCP-1339不久後就從D-345871身上拿掉。對象開始啜泣，並開始精神分裂。在精神分裂前，對象毫無條理地對研究員和博士吼叫了數分鐘，不斷地對他們發誓。D-345871返回牢房後的一週內大部份時間都待在床上。接著，他被發現死在自己的牢房內，死因是自己刺死自己。一把以牙刷做的粗糙“柄”被斷定是致死的武器。在他的牢房內發現了一份筆記，他在筆記內認了三項罪名：1932年在俄亥俄州哥倫布市的一起超商搶案，2003年在紐約州綺色佳市的一起受害者為女性的謀殺案，及西元前4750年在美索不達米亞的一起攻擊案。這些案件都正被基金會的歷史學家研究著。

在此事件之後，所有配戴過SCP-1339的對象都得強制進行心理輔導。

**實驗紀錄1339-1：** 
對象：一隻鸚鵡
戴上時間：30秒
對象動作：無
結果：鸚鵡無任何改變，研究員也沒注意到任何特別的。此次實驗後，研究員認為非靈長類動物不受SCP-1339之影響。

對象：一隻黑猩猩，學名*Pan troglodytes* 。
戴上時間：24小時
對象動作：進食，爬樹，騷擾其他猩猩。
結果：在移除SCP-1339後，對象似乎感到抑鬱，就像剛被人類關住的野生動物，但對象完全是被圈養長大的。數星期後，對象恢復正常。

對象：D-38546
戴上時間：30秒
對象動作：無
結果：對象在戴上SCP-1339後仍站在研究員前，但移除後感到了極度的憂鬱。在治療過程時，對象坦承對童年寵物之死（聯絡對象家屬後發現此事為真），在1905年襲擊和殺害一位流浪漢（對象出生前82年），及數個基金會計劃，包括[數據刪除]感到罪惡。對象隨後接受A級記憶消除並準時處決。

*備註：沒錯，SCP-1339對破案有幫助，但我們不能浪費寶貴的療程和藥物在D級人員上；不過拜訪警長，帶著一長串數十年前未破案的謀殺案及失蹤人口名單確實不是基金會所做過最詭異的事。實驗從現在起無限期延期直到被資深人員核准並監督。 -Easton博士*

**實驗記錄1339-2：** New testing has been authorized temporarily by Dr. Kiorst of Site-56, for the express purpose of determining if subjects using SCP-1339 are valid for use as Foundation personnel. Due to their lack of guilt or remorse while wearing SCP-1339, users have been speculated to be superior to regular personnel in dealing with more morally questionable actions performed by the Foundation.

对象：D-84766
戴上時間：Two (2) months
對象動作：D-84766 was given private quarters for the duration of the experiment, the only notable feature of which was a standard, 24-inch monitor, which was built into the wall for the express purpose of the experiment. Following the attachment of SCP-1339, D-84766 was led to the room and locked inside. Meals were delivered by staff three times a day. During the day, between the hours of six (6) A.M. and eight (8) P.M. (GMT), the monitor broadcast a live feed of Foundation activities declared to be the most morally questionable by personnel. Staff delivering meals were given the ability to request that the feed be muted or turned off while they visited the quarters. Following two months of exposure, D-84766 was brought out of her quarters and given a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Samson, who declared that D-84766 was mentally healthy.

D-84766 had SCP-1339 removed after evaluation. The subject entered a catatonic state upon removal, and began screaming incoherently. Nearby staff reported that the subject attempted to remove her own ears and eyes before being restrained by security. After being given a sedative, D-84766 was returned to her quarters, where she refused to speak to personnel for thirteen weeks. Attempts at administering therapy failed due to the subject's lack of response. On 9/3/2005, visiting staff reported that the subject was laying face down on the floor. Medical staff discovered that D-84766 was unconscious, and she was shortly thereafter transferred to the medical ward. After five (5) hours in the medical ward, the subject regained consciousness.

While in the medical ward, the subject was responsive to an interview by Dr. Samson (see Interview 1339-2). Following the interview, the subject stabbed herself thirteen times in chest, neck and face with an empty syringe. Death was caused by piercing of the subject's jugular. No note was found on the scene, but Dr. Samson did produce a paper the subject gave to him during their interview.

**採訪1339-2：** 
D-84766：Subject of SCP-1339 experimentation
Dr. Samson：Interviewing subject


> **Samson博士：** How are you feeling, D-84766?
> 
> **D-84766：** I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All of it.
> 
> **Samson博士：** Sorry for what?
> 
> **D-84766：** You know. I know. I know what I did.
> 
> **Samson博士：** Ma'am, you did not leave your quarters once during your wearing of SCP-133-
> 
> **D-84766：** Don't! No! I can't…can't…I was wrong…wrong, but I was right…it's all right, but it's all wrong…right and wrong…right and wrong right and wrong right and wrong right and wrong…
> 

**結語：** Following the end of the log, D-84766 subject threw a piece of paper at Dr. Samson. D-84766 then grabbed a syringe and committed suicide as outlined above. Dr. Samson immediately handed the note over to Foundation authorities. The note reads as follows:


> Topeka, Kansas, 1881. Murder. Mine.
> 
> Beijing, China, 1921. Burglary. Mine.
> 
> ██████, Site-56, 2005. [REDACTED]. All mine.
> 
> [The note continues for several paragraphs like this, naming locations, dates and crimes, and naming the subject as the perpetrator. The paper ends abruptly, indicating a date that has not yet occurred and naming a yet-unknown individual. Attempts to find this individual have been unsuccessful.]
> 

对象：Doctor Tamlin
戴上時間：Five (5) weeks.
對象動作：Doctor Tamlin performed his usual duties as administrator, among them approving testing and overseeing experiments. During the time SCP-1339 was worn, Dr. Tamlin approved all applications for experimentation given to him, eventually reaching the point of obviously humorous or false applications being approved, among them requests to set Keter class SCPs free, and petitions to promote violent D-Class personnel to 05O5. All approved applications were later vetoed by staff.

結果：Doctor Tamlin was deemed psychologically healthy following removal, though his wife and colleagues reported that he was notably less sociable. After two weeks, Dr. Tamlin failed to report to work, and agents were sent to his house to investigate. Once there, Agent Jotes and Agent Howard discovered the bodies of Dr. Tamlin and his wife, victims of an apparent murder-suicide. Both died of multiple stab wounds, Dr. Tamlin's self-inflicted. A note was discovered near his body, in which he confessed guilt to multiple crimes, including the murder of his wife.

*Note：That is it. This thing makes you able to handle some of what we do for a little while, but we can't have everybody involved with a 'messy accident' wind up killing themselves or others. All testing is ended. SCP-1339 is to be left in a locked storage area at Site-56, permanently. May those poor fuckers rest in peace. If they can.
-Doctor Kiorst*
